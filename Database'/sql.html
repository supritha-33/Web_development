    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational
        databases. It is widely used for tasks such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in databases
        like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. SQL uses simple, English-like syntax, making it easy
        to learn and understand.

        With SQL, users can create and modify database structures using commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. It also
        allows for querying data using SELECT, inserting data using INSERT, updating with UPDATE, and deleting using
        DELETE. Advanced features include joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and transactions, which help in
        handling complex data relationships and ensuring data integrity.

        SQL is essential for backend development, data analysis, business intelligence, and database administration. Its
        reliability, efficiency, and ability to handle large volumes of structured data make it a foundational skill in
        the world of data and software development.</p>
