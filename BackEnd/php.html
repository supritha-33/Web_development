    <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source server-side scripting language primarily used for web
        development. It is embedded within HTML and executed on the server to generate dynamic web page content. PHP is
        known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with various databases, especially MySQL. It
        supports object-oriented programming and a wide range of frameworks such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, and Symfony,
        which help in building robust and secure web applications. PHP is platform-independent and runs efficiently on
        all major operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is widely used in content management systems
        (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. PHP handles form data, session tracking, file uploads, and server-side
        validation with ease. With continuous updates and community support, PHP remains one of the most widely used and
        reliable technologies for backend development in web applications.</p>
