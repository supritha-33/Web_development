    <p>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the standard markup language for describing the structure of documents displayed on the web. HTML consists of a series of elements and attributes which are used to mark up all the components of a document to structure it in a meaningful way.

HTML documents are basically a tree of nodes, including HTML elements and text nodes. HTML elements provide the semantics and formatting for documents, including creating paragraphs, lists and tables, and embedding images and form controls. Each element may have multiple attributes specified. Many elements can have content, including other elements and text. Other elements are empty, with the tag and attributes defining their function.

There are several categories of elements, including metadata, sectioning, text, inline semantic, form, interactive, media, component, and scripting. </p>
